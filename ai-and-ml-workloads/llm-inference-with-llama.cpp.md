# LLM Inference with llama.cpp

**LLM Inference with llama.cpp**

llama.cpp is the primary recommended framework for running LLM inference on the CMP 170HX. It is a C/C++ inference engine that supports NVIDIA CUDA acceleration, uses GGUF quantized model formats, and can be compiled with the `-fmad=false` flag to bypass the FMA throttle.

**Why llama.cpp**

* Compiled C/C++ with CUDA — no Python overhead, direct GPU control
* Supports FP16, Q8\_0, Q4\_K\_M, Q5\_K\_M and other quantization levels
* Built-in `llama-bench` tool for systematic benchmarking
* Active development, broad model support (Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Phi, Gemma, etc.)
* Can be built with `-fmad=false` to work around the FMA throttle
* OpenAI-compatible server mode (`llama-server`) for API access

**What the arXiv Paper Found**

The 2025 arXiv paper (Xing Kangwei, 2505.03782) tested the CMP 170HX with llama-bench and found:

* FP32 inference: severely impacted by FMA throttle — low tokens/second
* **FP16 inference: over 3× improvement versus FP32** — the primary viable inference path
* Decode speed (token generation): memory-bandwidth bound — the CMP 170HX's strongest attribute
* Prefill speed (prompt processing): more compute-bound — more impacted by throttling
* Power efficiency (tokens/W) at FP16: competitive with consumer cards in its price range

The key finding is that FP16 quantization largely sidesteps the FMA throttle because FP16 operations take a different hardware path, and the decode phase of LLM inference is highly memory-bandwidth bound — exactly where the CMP 170HX excels.

**Installation**

**Step 1 — Install prerequisites**

bash

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git cmake build-essential ninja-build
# Verify CUDA toolkit is installed
nvcc --version
# Should show CUDA 12.x
```

**Step 2 — Clone and build llama.cpp with FMA disabled**

bash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp

cmake -B build \
  -DGGML_CUDA=ON \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS="-fmad=false" \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=80 \
  -DLLAMA_CURL=ON

cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

`-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=80` — targets GA100 (Compute Capability 8.0) exactly, avoiding unnecessary compilation for other architectures and reducing build time.

`-DCMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS="-fmad=false"` — disables FMA generation in all CUDA kernels, applying the workaround globally.

**Step 3 — Download a model**

Models must fit within 8GB VRAM. Recommended sizes for full GPU offload:

| Model             | Quantization | VRAM Usage | Recommended?                       |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Llama 3.2 3B      | Q8\_0        | \~3.5 GB   | ✅ Yes — fast, fits easily          |
| Llama 3.1 8B      | Q4\_K\_M     | \~5.5 GB   | ✅ Yes — good quality/speed balance |
| Llama 3.1 8B      | Q8\_0        | \~9 GB     | ❌ Exceeds 8GB                      |
| Mistral 7B        | Q4\_K\_M     | \~4.8 GB   | ✅ Yes                              |
| Mistral 7B        | Q5\_K\_M     | \~5.7 GB   | ✅ Yes                              |
| Qwen2.5 7B        | Q4\_K\_M     | \~5.0 GB   | ✅ Yes                              |
| Phi-3.5 Mini 3.8B | Q5\_K\_M     | \~3.2 GB   | ✅ Yes                              |
| Llama 3.1 70B     | any          | \~35 GB+   | ❌ Far exceeds 8GB                  |

bash

```bash
# Example: download Llama 3.1 8B Q4_K_M from Hugging Face
cd build/bin
wget https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

**Step 4 — Run inference**

bash

```bash
# Basic inference
./llama-cli \
  -m Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  -ngl 99 \
  -p "Explain the roofline model in GPU computing:" \
  -n 256

# -ngl 99 offloads all 99 layers to GPU — required for full GPU acceleration
```

**Step 5 — Benchmark with llama-bench**

bash

```bash
./llama-bench \
  -m Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  -ngl 99 \
  -p 512 \
  -n 128 \
  -r 3
```

Output will show:

* `pp` — prompt processing speed (tokens/second, prefill)
* `tg` — token generation speed (tokens/second, decode)

**Step 6 — Run as OpenAI-compatible server**

bash

```bash
./llama-server \
  -m Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  -ngl 99 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8080
```

The server exposes a `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint compatible with any OpenAI client library.

**Performance Expectations**

Based on the arXiv paper results and community testing, expected performance at FP16/Q4 quantization on a 7-8B model:

| Metric                   | Expected Range     | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Token generation (tg)    | 15–35 tokens/sec   | Memory-bandwidth bound — CMP 170HX's strength |
| Prompt processing (pp)   | 100–400 tokens/sec | More compute-dependent                        |
| VRAM usage (7B Q4\_K\_M) | \~5.5 GB           | Fits within 8GB                               |
| Power at load            | \~160–180W         | Integer + memory dominant workload            |

Token generation speed is the most user-relevant metric for interactive use. The CMP 170HX's 1,355 GB/s bandwidth makes it competitive here because decode is almost purely memory-bandwidth bound at batch size 1 — the GPU is continuously reading model weights from VRAM to generate each token.

**8GB VRAM Strategy**

8GB is a real constraint. To maximize what fits:

* Use Q4\_K\_M quantization as the default — best quality/size ratio
* Use Q3\_K\_M for models that are slightly too large at Q4
* Keep context length moderate — KV cache grows with context and consumes VRAM
* Use `--ctx-size 2048` or `--ctx-size 4096` rather than the default 8192 to reduce KV cache VRAM usage
* Do not run other CUDA processes simultaneously

**Benchmarking Your Setup**

After building, run the full benchmark suite and report results to the community:

bash

```bash
./llama-bench \
  -m your_model.gguf \
  -ngl 99 \
  -p 128,512,1024 \
  -n 64,128,256 \
  -r 5 \
  --output md
```

Submit your results with model name, quantization level, driver version, and VBIOS version.
